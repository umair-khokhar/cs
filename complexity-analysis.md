# Time Complexity Analysis
## O(n log n)
At each level, the input is halved, but the work performed remains **O(n)** (e.g., merge sort).

# Space complexity analysis 
## Input and Space Complexity
Space complexity is often determined as the additional space required beyond the input itself (auxiliary space complexity).
