# Time Complexity Analysis
## O(n log n)
At each level, the input is halved, but the work performed remains **O(n)** (e.g., merge sort).

## O(N ^ (h + 1))
To get time complexity of an algorithm that unfolds as a n-ary tree. Like recursion, backtracking etc.

# Space complexity analysis 
## Auxiliary space complexity
This refers to the extra space used by the algorithm excluding the input and output. It includes space used by recursion stacks, temporary variables, or additional data structures used within the function. ***Use this for academics and interviews***.

## Total space complexity
This includes both the auxiliary space and the space used by the output.
